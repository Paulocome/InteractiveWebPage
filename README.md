# Interactive Web Page Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple interactive web page built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It showcases several interactive features, including custom form validation, sliders, and dynamic content manipulation. The project is designed to be educational and easily extendable for further web development practice.

## Features

1. **Interactive Buttons**
   - **Change Background Color:** Randomly changes the page background when clicked.
   - **Toggle Text Visibility:** Shows or hides a specific paragraph dynamically.

2. **Custom Slider**
   - A range slider that displays its current value in real time.

3. **Custom Form Validation**
   - A contact form with fields for **name**, **email**, and **password**.
   - JavaScript checks:
     - All fields are filled.
     - Email is in a valid format.
     - Password has at least 6 characters.
   - Displays validation messages dynamically without relying on HTML5-only validation.

## Files Included

- `index.html` – Contains the structured HTML content with forms and interactive sections.
- `script.js` – Handles all JavaScript functionality including event listeners, interactive features, and custom form validation.
- `style.css` – Optional but included to style the web page and interactive elements.

## How to Use

3. Move the slider to see the current value update in real time.
